Sure! Here's an example of a Next.js component that renders an h1 tag with the text "Starmorph":

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Starmorph = () => {
  return <h1>Starmorph</h1>;
};

export default Starmorph;
```

You can use this component in your Next.js application by importing and including it in your desired page or layout component.
